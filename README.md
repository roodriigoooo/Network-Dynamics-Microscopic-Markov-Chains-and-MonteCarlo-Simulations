# Network-Dynamics-Microscopic-Markov-Chains-and-MonteCarlo-Simulations
This Python program is designed to simulate and visualize the dynamics of infectious diseases spreading through a network using the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model. It incorporates the Barab√°si-Albert model to generate networks that mimic the complex, scale-free nature of real-world social connections.
